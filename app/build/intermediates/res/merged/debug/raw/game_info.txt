Remake of the old arcade classic "Space Invaders".
The objective of the game is to defend yourself as long as you can from the alien space invaders.

Once you clear a level, a new is started.
The invaders will increase speed during the level and each level will start a bit faster than the previous.

The points are calculated like this:
Blue invader - 10 points
Yellow invader - 20 points
Orange invader - 30 points
Mystery UFO - 100-300 points

The HighScore list contains 20 entries.
If you get a better score than the lowest entry in the list, you are allowed to register your High Score.

The game can only be played in portrait mode.
The sound can be toggled on and off and there is also a pause button should the need for pausing the game arise.
